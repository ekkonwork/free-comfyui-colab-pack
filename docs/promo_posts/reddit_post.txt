Title:
[Free] ComfyUI Colab Pack for popular models (T4-friendly, GGUF-first, auto quant by VRAM)

Body:
Hey everyone,

I just open-sourced my Free ComfyUI Colab Pack for popular models.
Main goal: make testing and using strong models easier on Colab Free T4, without painful setup.

What is inside:
- model-specific Colab notebooks
- ready workflows per model
- GGUF-first approach for lower VRAM pressure
- auto quant selection by VRAM budget
- HF + Civitai token prompts
- stable Cloudflare tunnel launch logic

I spent a lot of time building and maintaining these notebooks as open source.
If this project helps you, stars, issues, and PRs are very welcome.

If you want to support development, even $1 helps a lot and goes to GPU server costs and food.
Donate info is in the repo.
